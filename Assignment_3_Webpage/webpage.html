        <h2>INVOLVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN WAR</h2>
        </div>
        <h3>Today's technology impacting the militarily</h3>        
        <p>In now a days information warfare in military is pretty commonly used and it has solved many problems in the past and the present so to have a better understanding let’s look at the chronology of it. Also, Technology shapes warfare, not war. War is an ongoing, global phenomenon. Almost every state known to human history has experienced it. Warfare is the act of fighting. It is an armed conflict or a military manoeuvre in the field. Whether or not the opposing forces engage in organised violence against one another, it involves what military specialists refer to as operations (Roland 2009). Personal computers (PCs) with modems started to appear more often in the late 1970s, not long after computer networks started to take off. Most of such machines were essentially property of commercial companies, where some programmers had created information database software that permitted users to exchange files and messages with the help of Internet, however, was the system that would fundamentally alter this circumstance. It was first known as ARPANET and was created in the early 1960s under the direction of the US Department of Defence (Advance Research Project Agency Network). Now that written communication was considerably more effective than oral communication for technical projects, military personnel could communicate more easily about them. Both disseminating information to the public and gathering information was very simple for them. Additionally, the network's experimental nature enabled them to make swift headway in resolving a significant number of technical issues.  Technology has a significant impact on how war is fought, how it is conducted, and how it exists. Today's carrier pigeons being replaced with 5G connections in places where they once existed. Wars, skirmishes, and conflicts are no longer conducted in vast theatres spanning several nations or continents; instead, they are increasingly being waged in smaller, more tactically focused, and often cyberspace-only arenas. A base equipped with hardy LCD monitors and rackmount keyboards is just as effective in contemporary conflict as a soldier with a dependable gun, and this represents a philosophical shift for militaries all over the world. Future military operations will increasingly rely on computer skills such as coding, hacking, and the usage of new hardware and software.
           Today, criminal organisations and foreign governments frequently pose a danger to military information systems. Due in significant part to the increased military reliance on the Internet, the impact of hacker activities and attempts to breach information systems has escalated (Nuses 1999). As a result, the Internet has significantly aided in the dismantling of barriers and, as we have previously shown, is currently one of the best platforms for the development of information warfare operations (Nuses 1999).

           <h3 style="color:rgb(78, 133, 64);"><U>HYPERSOMIC</U></h3>        
           <p></p>        
           <p>Second, hypersonic is describes any object moving at a speed that’s five or more times the speed of sound (761 miles per hour). Although basic hypersonic technology has been present for a while, advanced hypersonic military systems are currently undergoing testing in preparation for its 2022 deployment (Howarth 2022). The most striking aspect of this new technology is that these hypersonic missiles can manoeuvre in the air and travel at low altitudes, making it practically hard for missile defence systems to detect them. Russia, China, and the United States have been competing to develop their own hypersonic weaponry, concentrating on both offensive and defensive systems. Russia launched its first hypersonic missiles into Ukraine in the middle of March (Howarth 2022). </p>          
           <p><p>
            <h3 style="color:rgb(77, 138, 59);"><U>5G</U></h3>        
           <p></p>        
           <p>Appropriate and timely information is extremely critical to military operations. 5G, due to its fast speed, accelerates real-time decision support in the military. It promises hyper-converged connectivity and secure data networks. This enables new command-and-control applications and streamlines logistics. Further, 5G networks facilitate the transfer of massive amounts of data to distant sensors and weapons into dense, resilient battlefield networks. This provides instant situational awareness as well as enhances training and battlefield capabilities.Indian startup Niral Networks provides private 5G Infrastructure for last-mile connectivity. Its open and disaggregated network operating system, NiralOS, facilitates 5G and edge computing products. NiralOS integrates with any off-the-shelf white box hardware. For defense organizations, the 5G infrastructure enables rapid and cost-effective digital transformation at all fronts.</p>       
           <h3 style="color:rgb(77, 138, 59);"><U>ROBOTICS AND ARTIFICAIL INTELLIGENCNCE</U></h3>        
           <p></p>        
           <p>Protecting forces, increasing situational awareness, reducing soldiers’ physical and cognitive workload as well as facilitating movement in challenging terrains are a few crucial objectives for militaries. ​​The integration of RAS technologies allows militaries to achieve these objectives and control terrain, secure populations, and consolidate gains. RAS is increasingly important to ensure freedom of maneuver and mission accomplishment with the least possible risk to soldiers. The use of drones also enhances battlefield situational awareness. Moreover, multi-mission robots facilitate landmine clearance, search rescue operations, explosive ordnance disposal, and logistics support.</p> 
           <h3 style="color:rgb(77, 138, 59);"><U>BLOCKCHAIN</U></h3>       
           <p></p>        
           <p>Blockchain provides data security while sharing data with all concerned parties. This is why defense startups are building blockchain-based solutions for protecting confidential military data and countering cyber threats. Other applications of blockchain technology in the industry include device tracking, streamlining the procurement process, and supply chain security. Smart contracts significantly reduce the risk of fraud or corruption while dealing with defense contractors.US-based startup Taekion develops technology for military data protection. It leverages blockchain to secure defense data in tamper-proof storage. The UNIX-style distributed file system has built-in compression, encryption, and deduplication features and integrates seamlessly with existing infrastructure. The technology offers military-grade protection for information security at all levels. Moreover, the digital box feature enables forensic investigations after any cybersecurity attacks.</p> 
           <h3 style="color:rgb(77, 138, 59);"><U> IMMERSIVE TECHNILOGIES </U></h3>     
           <p></p>
           <p>The history of VR has often been influenced by the defense industry. One of the first VR projects was developed in the 1960s for a US military combat system. Virtual reality has always played a significant role in the military field and was adopted by all services: army, navy, and air force. It is mostly used for army training purposes, but there are other use cases where VR is a powerful tool.

            Virtual reality is a computer-generated environment that enables the viewer to immerse themselves in their 3D data. Military and defense are one of the industries where virtual and augmented reality technologies are most widely used. VR is even one of the key technologies listed by the US Department of Defense in the 21st century. In this article, let’s discover the current uses of Virtual Reality in the defense industry and the military industry. Also,Military flight simulators are critical for training pilots. High-fidelity simulations help to safely expose and prepare pilots-in-training for challenging real-world scenarios. For instance, you can have a flight simulator overlaid with a virtual world rendering an actual battlefield for a complete pilot training (this type of virtual reality simulation can be done using TechViz Fusion). All the user’s senses can be stimulated to fully recreate the pilot training. In addition,A lot of heavy equipment and military vehicles are intensive and complex electromechanical systems. Knowing how they function and how to operate them safely is an essential training for participants who need to familiarize themselves on a particular piece of equipment, to help refresh and develop their existing skill set.
